### I have gone through a difficult time ###

It was difficut for me to build the project becasue I made a number of bad choices. For example, 
* I should have started early
* I should not have tried to be come perfect at the start
* I should have a plan first
* I should not have tried to make it a huge project

## My project has received as follows ##

 ### Are there still problem? ###

 Yes, there are still problems which I know but could  not fix due to time pressure.

## Final comment ##
I am extremely sorry that I could not do proper justice to the project. However, I learned valuable lessons while creating it. I mean, I leaned more while practically doing it instead of waching/reading materials. Therefore, as I mentioned before, I should have started early. Next time, for my other projects, I will definitely start early.

#### Thank you fo your attention ###
